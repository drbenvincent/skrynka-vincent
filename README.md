This repository contains data and analysis code for the paper:

> Skrynka, J., & Vincent, B. T. (2017, July 26). Hunger increases delay discounting of food and non-food rewards. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qgp54

**STATUS: Under review**


## Data

- `data/discounting/` files in this folder correspond to the raw delay discounting choice data
- `data/data.csv` contains participant data for both conditions, including the subjective hunger measures.


## Analyses

The analyses were conducted in Python and are presented in the form of a number of Jupyter notebooks in the `analysis` folder. These can be viewed online (either on the OSF or in GitHub). Running these notebooks will produce a series of outputs which are also contained in the `analysis` folder. These outputs are primarily generated figures or generated data stored in `.csv` files.

There is also a `.jasp` file which includes Bayesian repeated measures t-tests. This filetype should be viewable online, but can also be viewed and explored in the JASP software available from https://jasp-stats.org.
